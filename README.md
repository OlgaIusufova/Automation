# Automation.
## Project_09. Building a Data Pipelines for the Sterling &amp; Draper advertising agency.

You work as a video ad analyst at the Sterling & Draper advertising agency. You devote a lot of time to analyzing trending videos on YouTube to determine what content deserves marketing attention.<br>
Each video has a specific category (Entertainment, Music, News & Politics, etc.), region, and trending date.<br>
A video can be in the trending section for several days in a row.
*Every week, the new employees Melanie and Ashok ask you the same questions:*
- What video categories were trending last week?
- How were they distributed among various regions?
- What categories were especially popular in the United States? <br>

In your sixth week on the job, you decide that it's high time the process were automated. You're going to make a dashboard for Melanie and Ashok.

After talking to the managers and database administrators, you've drawn up brief technical requirements:<br>
- Business goal: analyze trending-video history on YouTube
- How often the dashboard will be used: at least once a day
- Target dashboard user: video ads planning managers
- Dashboard data content:
  - Trending videos from the past, broken down by day and category
  - Trending videos, broken down by countries
  - A table of correspondence between categories and countries
- Parameters according to which the data is to be grouped:
  - Trending date and time
  - Video category
  - Country
- The data:
  - Trending history — absolute values with a breakdown by day (two graphs: absolute numbers and percentage ratio)
  - Events, broken down by countries — relative values (% of events)
  - The correspondence between the categories and countries — absolute values (a table)
- Importance: all graphs are equally important
- Data sources for the dashboard: the data engineers promised to create an aggregate table called ```trending_by_time```. Here's its structure:
  - ```record_id``` — primary key
  - ```region``` — country/geographical region
  - ```trending_date``` — date and time
  - ```category_title``` — the video category
  - ```videos_count``` — the number of videos in the trending section
- The table is stored in the data-analyst-youtube-data. database, which was created especially for your needs
- Data update interval: once every 24 hours, at midnight UTC
