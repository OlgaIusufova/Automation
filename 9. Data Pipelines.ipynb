    "## Building a Data Pipelines for the Sterling & Draper advertising agency\n",
    "\n",
    "You work as a video ad analyst at the Sterling & Draper advertising agency. You devote a lot of time to analyzing trending videos on YouTube to determine what content deserves marketing attention.<br>\n",
    "Each video has a specific category (Entertainment, Music, News & Politics, etc.), region, and trending date.<br>\n",
    "A video can be in the trending section for several days in a row.\n",
    "*Every week, the new employees Melanie and Ashok ask you the same questions:*\n",
    "- What video categories were trending last week?\n",
    "- How were they distributed among various regions?\n",
    "- What categories were especially popular in the United States? <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In your sixth week on the job, you decide that it's high time the process were automated. You're going to make a dashboard for Melanie and Ashok.\n",
    "\n",
    "After talking to the managers and database administrators, you've drawn up brief technical requirements:<br>\n",
    "- Business goal: analyze trending-video history on YouTube\n",
    "- How often the dashboard will be used: at least once a day\n",
    "- Target dashboard user: video ads planning managers\n",
    "- Dashboard data content:\n",
    "  - Trending videos from the past, broken down by day and category\n",
    "  - Trending videos, broken down by countries\n",
    "  - A table of correspondence between categories and countries\n",
    "- Parameters according to which the data is to be grouped:\n",
    "  - Trending date and time\n",
    "  - Video category\n",
    "  - Country\n",
    "- The data:\n",
    "  - Trending history — absolute values with a breakdown by day (two graphs: absolute numbers and percentage ratio)\n",
    "  - Events, broken down by countries — relative values (% of events)\n",
    "  - The correspondence between the categories and countries — absolute values (a table)\n",
    "- Importance: all graphs are equally important\n",
    "- Data sources for the dashboard: the data engineers promised to create an aggregate table called ```trending_by_time```. Here's its structure:\n",
    "  - ```record_id``` — primary key\n",
    "  - ```region``` — country/geographical region\n",
    "  - ```trending_date``` — date and time\n",
    "  - ```category_title``` — the video category\n",
    "  - ```videos_count``` — the number of videos in the trending section\n",
    "- The table is stored in the data-analyst-youtube-data. database, which was created especially for your needs\n",
    "- Data update interval: once every 24 hours, at midnight UTC\n"
